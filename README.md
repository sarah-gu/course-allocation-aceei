# How to run 
The jupyter notebook aceei.ipynb contains the steps and setup for the fair course allocation algorithm. Real course waitlist data is read in from onlywaitlists.csv, supplied by the Columbia CS Department. 

demand_set.csv are the random demand sets generated from our specific run of the dataset. Use these demand sets to generate the exact output and reproduce our results from the paper.
